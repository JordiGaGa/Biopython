Heterogeneity among both primed and naive pluripotent stem cell lines remains a 
major unresolved problem. Here we show that expressing the maternal-specific 
linker histone H1FOO fused to a destabilizing domain (H1FOO-DD), together with 
OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and LMYC, in human somatic cells improves the quality of 
reprogramming to both primed and naive pluripotency. H1FOO-DD expression was 
associated with altered chromatin accessibility around pluripotency genes and 
with suppression of the innate immune response. Notably, H1FOO-DD generates 
naive induced pluripotent stem cells with lower variation in transcriptome and 
methylome among clones and a more uniform and superior differentiation potency. 
Furthermore, we elucidated that upregulation of FKBP1A, driven by these five 
factors, plays a key role in H1FOO-DD-mediated reprogramming.

Biological patterning events that occur early in development establish proper 
tissue morphogenesis. Identifying the mechanisms that guide these patterning 
events is necessary in order to understand the molecular drivers of development 
and disease and to build tissues in vitro. In this study, we use an in vitro 
model of gastrulation to study the role of tight junctions and 
apical/basolateral polarity in modulating bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP4) 
signaling and gastrulation-associated patterning in colonies of human 
pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Disrupting tight junctions via knockdown (KD) of 
the scaffolding tight junction protein-1 (TJP1, also known as ZO1) allows BMP4 
to robustly and ubiquitously activate pSMAD1/5 signaling over time, resulting in 
loss of the patterning phenotype and marked differentiation bias of pluripotent 
stem cells to primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs). These findings give 
important insights into how signaling events are regulated and lead to spatial 
emergence of diverse cell types in vitro.

Naive human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated by 
reprogramming somatic cells with Sendai virus (SeV) vectors. However, only 
dermal fibroblasts have been successfully reprogrammed this way, and the process 
requires culture on feeder cells. Moreover, SeV vectors are highly persistent 
and inhibit subsequent differentiation of iPSCs. Here, we report a modified SeV 
vector system to generate transgene-free naive human iPSCs with superior 
differentiation potential. The modified method can be applied not only to 
fibroblasts but also to other somatic cell types. SeV vectors disappear quickly 
at early passages, and this approach enables the generation of naive iPSCs in a 
feeder-free culture. The naive iPSCs generated by this method show better 
differentiation to trilineage and extra-embryonic trophectoderm than those 
derived by conventional methods. This method can expand the application of iPSCs 
to research on early human development and regenerative medicine.

BACKGROUND: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are expected to be 
useful for regenerative medicine for many diseases. Many researchers have 
focused on and enabled the generation of differentiated cells or tissue-like 
structures, including organoids, which help to ameliorate target diseases. To 
promote such cell therapies, we established a clinically applicable iPSC 
haplobank matching as many people as possible in Japan.
METHODS: Through cooperation with several organizations, we recruited donors 
whose human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) involved in immunorejection were 
homozygous. The peripheral or umbilical cord blood collected from the donors was 
used for iPSC production by electroporation of episomal vectors. These iPSC 
lines were then subjected to testing, including genome analyses and sterility, 
to maximize safety.
FINDINGS: We constructed a clinical-grade haplobank of 27 iPSC lines from 7 
donors according to good manufacturing practice regulations. However, reasons to 
avoid using iPSC lines include the presence of residual episomal vectors or 
genetic mutations in cancer-related genes.
CONCLUSIONS: This haplobank provides HLA-matched iPSC lines for approximately 
40% of the Japanese population. Since the haplobank's release in 2015, these 
iPSC lines have been used in more than 10 clinical trials. The establishment of 
this haplobank is an important step toward the clinical application of iPSCs in 
cell therapies.
FUNDING: This study was supported by a research center network for 
the realization of regenerative medicine of the Japan Agency for Medical 
Research and Development (AMED) under grant number JP20bm0104001h0108.
