Cell autocloning as a pathway to their real rejuvenation.

The article gives a brief description of geroprotection and rejuvenation methods 
known to date, presenting their main mechanisms and limitations. To overcome the 
main limitations of the process of rejuvenation, it is possible to use a process 
called "cell autocloning." The principle of the proposed method of rejuvenation 
is as follows: a periodic process of autocloning of the cell nucleus is 
initiated in the cellular genome with the formation of one unstable daughter 
copy and its subsequent self-elimination. In this case, the process of cell 
division stops in the phase of nuclei divergence without subsequent physical 
separation of the cell itself. This is especially important for postmitotic 
cells, where the looping of the "unidirectional" line of the ontogenesis program 
into a "ring" will mean their transition into renewable cells. The prototype for 
autocloning mechanisms could be the already known ways in which cells adapt to 
the increasing amount of their damage over time. These are polyploidy and 
asymmetric cell division, relying on which it is possible to obtain a renewable 
process of cell nuclei division, when only the original nucleus remains as a 
result of division. Although this is not a simple task, there are possible 
pathways to its solution using approaches that can suggest modern knowledge from 
the field of molecular and cell biology and genetics. The realization of such a 
goal will require a lot of work, but the expected result justifies it.

This paper presents a global statistical analysis of the RNA-Seq results of the 
entire Mus musculus genome. We explain aging by a gradual redistribution of 
limited resources between two major tasks of the organism: its self-sustenance 
based on the function of the housekeeping gene group (HG) and functional 
differentiation provided by the integrative gene group (IntG). All known 
disorders associated with aging are the result of a deficiency in the repair 
processes provided by the cellular infrastructure. Understanding exactly how 
this deficiency arises is our primary goal. Analysis of RNA production data of 
35,630 genes, from which 5,101 were identified as HG genes, showed that RNA 
production levels in the HG and IntG genes had statistically significant 
differences (p-value <0.0001) throughout the entire observation period. In the 
reproductive period of life, which has the lowest actual mortality risk for Mus 
musculus, changes in the age dynamics of RNA production occur. The statistically 
significant dynamics of the decrease of RNA production in the HG group in 
contrast to the IntG group was determined (p-value = 0.0045). The trend toward 
significant shift in the HG/IntG ratio occurs after the end of the reproductive 
period, coinciding with the beginning of the mortality rate increase in Mus 
musculus indirectly supports our hypothesis. The results demonstrate a different 
orientation of the impact of ontogenesis regulatory mechanisms on the groups of 
genes representing cell infrastructures and their organismal functions, making 
the chosen direction promising for further research and understanding the 
mechanisms of aging.

Aging is a Side Effect of the Ontogenesis Program of Multicellular Organisms.

The review presents a brief outline of the current state of the main theoretical 
approaches to the aging problem. The works of authors, supporting the theory of 
"accumulation of errors" and theories stating the presence of a hypothetical 
"aging program" in all multicellular organisms are reviewed. The role of 
apoptosis and its connection with phenoptosis, as well as the theory of 
"hyperfunction" are analyzed. Our own approach to this problem is presented, in 
which aging is explained by the redistribution of limited resources between the 
two main aims of the organism: its self-sufficiency, based on the function of 
the housekeeping genes (HG) group, and functional specialization, provided by 
the integrative genes (IntG) group. Agreeing with the inseparable connection 
between aging and the ontogenesis program, the main role in the aging mechanisms 
is assigned to the redistribution of resources from the HG self-sufficiency 
genes to the IntGs necessary for the operation of all specialized functions of 
the organism as a whole. The growing imbalance between HGs and IntGs with age, 
suggests that switching of cellular resources in favor of IntGs is a side effect 
of ontogenesis program implementation and the main reason for aging, inherent in 
the nature of genome functioning under conditions of highly integrated 
multicellularity. The hypothesis of functional subdivision of the genome also 
points to the leading role of slow-dividing and postmitotic cells, as the most 
sensitive to reduction of repair levels, for triggering and realization of the 
aging process.

From Autonomy to Integration, From Integration to Dynamically Balanced 
Integrated Co-existence: Non-aging as the Third Stage of Development.

Reversible senescence at the cellular level emerged together with tissue 
specialization in Metazoans. However, this reversibility (ability to permanently 
rejuvenate) through recapitulation of early stages of development, was 
originally a part of ontogenesis, since the pressure of integrativeness was not 
dominant. The complication of specialization in phylogenesis narrowed this 
"freedom of maneuver", gradually "truncating" remorphogenesis to local 
epimorphosis and further up to the complete disappearance of remorphogenesis 
from the ontogenesis repertoire. This evolutionary trend transformed cellular 
senescence into organismal aging and any recapitulation of autonomy into 
carcinogenesis. The crown of specialization, Homo sapiens, completed this 
post-unicellular stage of development, while in the genome all the potential for 
the next stage of development, which can be called the stage of balanced 
coexistence of autonomous and integrative dominants within a single whole. Here, 
completing the substantiation of the new section of developmental biology, we 
propose to call it Developmental Biogerontology.

The Ratio of the Genome Two Functional Parts Activity as the Prime Cause of 
Aging.

The metazoan genome composes of sets of housekeeping genes (HG) for fundamental 
cellular autonomous processes and integrative genes (IntG) that provide 
integrative functions and form the body as an integrated whole. The main 
paradigm for multicellularity development which has been improved in evolution, 
is the submission of the cellular autonomy to the interests of the integrated 
whole. Permanent increase of the "functional tax" of IntG-genome (IntG-shift) 
and epigenetic restriction of autonomy in phylogenesis/ontogenesis is the 
essence and root cause of aging, inherent in the very nature of highly 
integrated multicellularity. The regulation of the balance shift toward HG can 
be managed to eliminate aging and avoid carcinogenesis, which is only due to the 
irreversibility of this shift. Here we propose the criterion for measuring the 
functional and biological age of cells and the body as a whole for assessing the 
effectiveness of any type of palliative geroprotective or radical anti-aging 
intervention.

From cancer to rejuvenation: incomplete regeneration as the missing link (part

In the first part of our study, we substantiated that the embryonic 
reontogenesis and malignant growth (disintegrating growth) pathways are the 
same, but occur at different stages of ontogenesis, this mechanism is carried 
out in opposite directions. Cancer has been shown to be epigenetic-blocked 
redifferentiation and unfinished somatic embryogenesis. We formulated that only 
this approach of aging elimination has real prospects for a future that is 
fraught with cancer, as we will be able to convert this risk into a rejuvenation 
process through the continuous cycling of cell dedifferentiation-differentiation 
processes (permanent remorphogenesis). Here, we continue to develop the idea of 
looped ontogenesis and formulate the concept of the rejuvenation circle.
